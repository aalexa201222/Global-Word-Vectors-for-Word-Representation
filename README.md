# GloVe Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a small-scale variant of the Global Word Vectors for Word Representation, commonly known as the GloVe paper. The objective is to represent words as dense vectors in a finite-dimensional space, enabling space-efficient storage and computation of semantic content for natural language processing tasks.

## Background

Representing words as dense vectors has been a significant breakthrough in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Vectorial representations allow for efficient and informationally rich storage of words, capturing their semantic content and facilitating numerical computation. Word vectors serve as the standard input representation for various machine learning architectures in language processing.

While new methods for constructing word representations continue to emerge, the original set of published papers, such as the GloVe paper, remains a de facto point of reference. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of a small-scale variant of the GloVe paper, serving as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a small-scale variant of the GloVe paper.
- Word representations as dense vectors for efficient storage and computation.
- Suitable for integration into machine learning architectures for language processing.

## Requirements
